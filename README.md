# Voting-App
The online voting system utilizes tools like Android Studio, XML, JAVA, and the Android Emulator to create a seamless experience for administrators and users. It comprises an admin module for creating and scheduling voting sessions, and a user module for hassle-free voting. During registration, the system verifies the identity of voters by matching their snapshot with existing data and sends an OTP to their registered phone numbers. Users can then vote by entering the OTP, with the system incorporating face verification for added security. This technologically advanced solution aims to streamline the voting process, enhance convenience, and ensure the integrity of elections.
